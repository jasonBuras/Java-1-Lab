/*Jason Buras Problem 8: RSA Public Key
Input
First line represents the number of test cases. 
Each line there after, consists of three positive integers. 
The first integer represents the p terms, the second integer represents the q term, 
the third integer represents the e term.
Output
For each pair of integers, determine if they are not valid for key generation. 
if not, either print "Invalid n for RSA Key!" or "Invalid e for RSA Key!" 
depending on which is not valid. Otherwise, print "RSA Public Key: n=%d e=%d" 
with n and e respectively.
